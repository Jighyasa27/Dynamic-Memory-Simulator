# 🧠 Dynamic Memory Management Simulator

This is a **web-based educational simulator** that demonstrates various **memory management and process scheduling techniques** used in Operating Systems. It allows users to interactively visualize how memory is allocated, compacted, and scheduled using multiple algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

### 📦 Memory Allocation
- Supports **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, **Worst Fit**, and **Next Fit** strategies
- Allocate and deallocate memory blocks dynamically
- Visualize **external fragmentation**
- Perform **memory compaction** to reduce fragmentation

### 📄 Paging Simulation
- Simulate how a process is divided into pages
- Visualize page-to-frame mapping in physical memory
- Supports custom process size, page size, and memory size

### 📊 Segmentation Simulation
- Input logical segments (e.g., Code, Stack, Data)
- Visualize segment allocation in memory
- Useful for understanding logical vs physical memory layout

### ⏱️ Process Scheduling
- Add processes with burst time
- Simulate **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)** scheduling
- Simulate **Round Robin (RR)** scheduling with configurable time quantum
